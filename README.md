Web-Scraping w/ python to get temperatures in Celsius
You input the url as the functions argument and it prints out the temperature in celsisus. 

You must visit the site https://www.weather.gov/ and then type in your zip code or any other relevant information. After doing that, you copy the link and put it inside
functions argument. It's not the best but it works. Will add selenium functionality if I decide to update.
